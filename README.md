# Mini-Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small, focused machine learning and data science mini-projects.  
Each mini-project demonstrates a specific technique, workflow, or concept without the scale or depth of a full case study or flagship project.

## Purpose
- Showcase technical breadth across different areas of data science
- Practice implementing clean, reproducible workflows
- Maintain modular, skill-focused notebooks that complement larger portfolio projects

## Project Organization
Mini-projects are grouped by skill or technique category:

- `machine_learning/` — Projects involving supervised learning models like classification and regression.
- `data_cleaning/` — Projects focused on data wrangling, missing value handling, and data preparation techniques.
- `visualization/` — Projects centered on data exploration and visualization.
- `geospatial_projects/` — Projects involving spatial datasets, mapping, and geographic analysis.
- `automation_scripts/` — Small scripts automating repetitive data tasks or workflow processes.


Each mini-project subfolder typically includes:
- A Jupyter Notebook
- A `README.md` file summarizing the project
- A `requirements.txt` listing necessary libraries

## Notes
- Mini-projects are intended to be lightweight and self-contained.
- These notebooks prioritize practical application over exhaustive deep dives.
- More complex, domain-specific projects are housed in the [Real-World Data Case Studies](https://github.com/J1111-dotcom/real-world-data-case-studies) repository.
