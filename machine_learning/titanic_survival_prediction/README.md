# Titanic Survival Prediction (Mini-Project)

This mini-project builds and evaluates two classification models to predict passenger survival on the Titanic, using a light, real-world data science workflow.

## Dataset
- Source: seaborn built-in Titanic dataset
- 891 passenger records
- Features include class, sex, age, number of relatives aboard, fare, embarkation point, and whether the passenger was alone.

## Workflow
- Light data cleaning and missing value handling
- Feature encoding for categorical variables
- Train-test split
- Training and evaluation of:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Comparison of model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix

## Results
- Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 83%, slightly outperforming Logistic Regression (80%).
